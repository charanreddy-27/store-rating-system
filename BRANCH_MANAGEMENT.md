## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

### 2. Feature Integration
```bash
# Switch to development
git checkout development

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/new-feature

# Push updated development
git push origin development
```

### 3. Release to Production
```bash
# Switch to master
git checkout master

# Merge development
git merge development

# Tag release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Push to production
git push origin master --tags
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```bash
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication system
fix(api): resolve user registration validation error
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(frontend): improve responsive design layout
refactor(backend): optimize database queries
test(api): add unit tests for user service
chore(deps): update npm dependencies
```

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines
1. **Create PR from feature branch to development**
2. **Add descriptive title and description**
3. **Include screenshots for UI changes**
4. **Request review from team members**
5. **Ensure all tests pass**
6. **Update documentation if needed**

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications considered

## Release Strategy

### Version Numbering (Semantic Versioning)
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Process
1. **Feature freeze** on development branch
2. **Testing and bug fixes**
3. **Merge to master**
4. **Create release tag**
5. **Deploy to production**
6. **Create release notes**

## Hotfix Process

For critical production issues:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from master
git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# Make fix and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical production issue"

# Merge to both master and development
git checkout master
git merge hotfix/critical-fix
git checkout development  
git merge hotfix/critical-fix

# Push changes
git push origin master
git push origin development
```

## Branch Protection Rules

### Master Branch
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict who can push to matching branches
- Require review from code owners

### Development Branch
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Allow force pushes (for rebasing)

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# Example CI/CD pipeline
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, development ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```

## Team Collaboration

### Daily Workflow
1. **Pull latest changes** from development
2. **Create feature branch** for new work
3. **Commit frequently** with clear messages
4. **Push changes** regularly
5. **Create PR** when feature is complete
6. **Review team PRs** promptly
7. **Merge approved features** to development

### Communication
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Comment on complex code sections
- Update project documentation
- Communicate breaking changes
- Share knowledge through code reviews

This workflow ensures code quality, team collaboration, and smooth releases!
