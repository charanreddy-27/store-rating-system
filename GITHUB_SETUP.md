# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository" or the "+" icon
3. Set repository name: `store-rating-system` 
4. Add description: "Full-stack store rating application with NestJS backend and React frontend"
5. Choose "Public" (recommended for showcasing to reviewers)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/store-rating-system.git

# Push main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# Push all feature branches
git push origin development
git push origin feature/backend-api
git push origin feature/frontend-ui
git push origin feature/authentication
git push origin feature/rating-system
```

## Step 3: Set Default Branch (Optional)

If you want to use 'main' instead of 'master':

```bash
# Rename local branch
git branch -m master main

# Update remote
git push -u origin main

# Delete old master branch on remote
git push origin --delete master
```

## Step 4: Branch Strategy

### Main Branches:
- **master/main**: Production-ready code
- **development**: Integration branch for features

### Feature Branches:
- **feature/backend-api**: NestJS API implementation
- **feature/frontend-ui**: React frontend components
- **feature/authentication**: JWT auth system
- **feature/rating-system**: Rating and review functionality

### Workflow:
1. Create feature branches from `development`
2. Merge completed features into `development`
3. When ready for release, merge `development` into `master/main`

## Step 5: Repository Protection (Recommended)

In GitHub repository settings:
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add protection rule for `master/main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks
   - Restrict who can push to branch

## Step 6: Add Collaborators (If Needed)

1. Go to Settings → Manage access
2. Click "Invite a collaborator"
3. Add team members or reviewers
